# Simple_Linear_Regression
Simple linear regression is a fundamental statistical method used in data science to model the relationship between two variables: a dependent variable (target) and an independent variable (predictor).
It seeks to find the best-fitting line through the data points, allowing us to predict the target variable's values based on the predictor variable's values. In this assignment, I will showcase the implementation of simple linear regression using Python and its application to a real-world dataset, demonstrating its predictive capabilities and model evaluation.
